# Animots
French Android app for children. The goal is to help them start recognizing words, as an introduction to learning how to read. There is currently no English version of the app.

There are 3 different levels in the app:
- Level 1: every word appears beneath the corresponding image.
- Level 2: at first glance, the images are hidden and only revealed if the user makes a mistake.
- Level 3: no images at all.

It is possible to save scores after playing. To make the learning of new words more engaging, a random mode can be activated so that the animal to pick is different each time.

Future implementations:
- an English version
- different word packs to go beyond animals
